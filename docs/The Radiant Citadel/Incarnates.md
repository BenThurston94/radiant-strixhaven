The Dawn Incarnates are held with reverence generally but those two civilizations have some interesting ties. San Citlan is split whether the incarnate is actually a collection of their ancestors. San Citlan has festivals and celebrations very heavily inspired by Dia de los Muertos. Therefore some believe that the Incarnates cannot be made of their ancestors, because those ancestors come to visit them on those holy celebrations. Others believe that ancestors spend time insuring a family is safe before travelling to the Citadel to join their Incarnate. There is a much smaller group of zealots that believe The Incarnate releases their ancestors souls temporarily on those celebrations. The incarnates themselves are an area of heavy research for some Witherbloom Scholars.


Yeonido is much less divided on The Incarnates. There are many traditions aimed at guiding a dying soul to The Amethyst Tiger in The Citadel. Additionally there is a lot of societal pressure to continue to revere particularly important ancestors, with many shrine parks within the city dedicated to one or two people in particular. All of this is aimed at preventing someone from becoming gwishin.
