**Djaynai & Janya** (Jay-nigh JAN-yah): Modern Djaynai is a coastal realm descended from a grand civilization. Though the nation has never been defeated by external forces, its fortunes were greatly diminished hundreds of years ago after raiders perpetrated atrocities upon the land and its people in a series of attacks known as the Passage of Vultures. Djaynai’s defenders drove the raiders off, albeit at a high cost. Even in its diminished state, the nation serves as an exemplar of self-sovereignty and dignity, defended by scouts known as the Lightsea Lancers, who watch for bandit groups and marauders aiming to raid Djaynai and its neighbors. During the Passage of Vultures, countless captured Djaynaians leaped from the ships of the marauders, like raindrops falling into the sea. “Freedom now!” they shouted as they sought the ocean’s embrace. In the midnight depths, those ancient Djaynaians called upon their magic and that of the Nightsea, and they were transformed into beings dubbed Nightsea chil-liren, gifted with the ability to live in the deep. Over centuries, they became the civilization known as Janya.

**TLDR:** A seaside and underwater city known for their maritime prowess and splendid architecture.
