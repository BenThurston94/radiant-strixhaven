Djaynai\u2019s defenders drove the raiders off, albeit at a high cost. Even in its diminished state, the nation serves as an exemplar of self-sovereignty and dignity, defended by scouts known as the Lightsea Lancers, who watch for bandit groups and marauders aiming to raid Djaynai and its neighbors. During the Passage of Vultures, countless captured Djaynaians leaped from the ships of the marauders, like raindrops falling into the sea. \u201cFreedom now!\u201d they shouted as they sought the ocean\u2019s embrace. In the midnight depths, those ancient Djaynaians called upon their magic and that of the Nightsea, and they were transformed into beings dubbed Nightsea chil-liren, gifted with the ability to live in the deep.

Therefore some believe that the Incarnates cannot be made of their ancestors, because those ancestors come to visit them on those holy celebrations. Others believe that ancestors spend time insuring a family is safe before travelling to the Citadel to join their Incarnate. There is a much smaller group of zealots that believe The Incarnate releases their ancestors souls temporarily on those celebrations. The incarnates themselves are an area of heavy research for some Witherbloom Scholars.</p> <p>Yeonido is much less divided on The Incarnates. There are many traditions aimed at guiding a dying soul to The Amethyst Tiger in The Citadel. Additionally there is a lot of societal pressure to continue to revere particularly important ancestors, with many shrine parks within the city dedicated to one or two people in particular.

The Citadel sits perched on land wrapping around a giant Crystal. Within the citadel is the five colleges that make up Strixhaven, as well as a trade center focused on magical wares and general supplies for the school. The Civilizations that fund Strixhaven are connected with The Citadel via Concord Gems, contstructs capable of traversal of large amounts of goods and people to and from the hidden settlement. Funding from these civilizations causes student tuition to be relatively low. A complete course of study with scholarships typically cost students 1000 gold, and 2000 gold without scholarships. </p> <p>At the base of the Crystal is a large circular complex known as The Hall of Whispers. It is here information is brokered between spies, criers, and locals. The Hall is often at odds with Strixhaven, as knowledge from the school is safeguarded from those that would use it poorly. </p> <p>Inside the giagantic crystal is The Preserve of Elders. It is here spirits conglomerate in to beings known as Incarnates. The largest of these Incarnates, thought to be conglomerations of souls from the founding civilizations, are known as Dawn Incarnates. Councilors from each of the founding civilizations govern The Citadel from The Preserve, mandating trade laws and municiple matters so that The University is the most dangerous part of The Citadel. The Council seems to turn a blind eye to The Hall of Whispers, and even tends to employ their services from time to time.
